                            consist of 4 convolutional layers with a variation of 
                        filter and kernel size from 32 to 128 and (3,3) to (2,2)
                        respectively. </li></p>

                            from <i>RELU</i> activation function, except for the 
                            last output dense layers makes use of <i>sigmoid</i> activation
                        function since it's a binary classification problem.</li> </p>

                        that the proposed model is trained. Upon evaluation on testing data, the
                         proposed model yields the accuracy of 99.9% with a bare minimum loss of
                         0.006% which is a state-of-the-art Performance and in fact is able to 
                         classify cotton leaf correctly.</p>

                            able to classify cotton leaf infection based on it's type
